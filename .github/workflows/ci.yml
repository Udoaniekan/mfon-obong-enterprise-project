# ===========================================
# CI Workflow - Runs on EVERY push to ANY branch
# ===========================================
# Purpose: Make sure code compiles and tests pass

name: CI - Test & Build

# When to run this workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '*'           # Run on ALL branches
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
      - staging
      - production

# The jobs to run
jobs:
  test-and-build:
    name: Test and Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    # Use Ubuntu server (free from GitHub)

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the code from the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'        # Cache npm dependencies for faster builds

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run linting (check code style)
      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint
        continue-on-error: true   # Don't fail the build if linting has warnings

      # Step 5: Run tests (if you have them)
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test --if-present
        continue-on-error: true   # Don't fail if no tests exist yet

      # Step 6: Build the application
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      # Step 7: Confirm build succeeded
      - name: Verify build output
        run: |
          if [ -d "dist" ]; then
